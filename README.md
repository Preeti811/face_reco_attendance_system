### Project flow & explaination
- Used open cv for face detection and determination of contour of image.
- @created database in SQL 
- @created gui using ktinker
- @created face detection and recognition model using Haarcascade
- First it will image capture for new user and will save in a directory and will store personal data of user in SQL database.
- @then it will train images data...
- After image training happens 'Training data.XML'  file will be stored which will contain trained data information.
- From this file only  the features of the  face that is  detected by camera will be compared....and result will be displayed on screen...
- If face is recognised the individual's id will be displayed there
- @then we will open gui 'find face'
- Where it will match face with existing data's....
- If face detected attendance will be marked and will be stored in a .CSV file.
